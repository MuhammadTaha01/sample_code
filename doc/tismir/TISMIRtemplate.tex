A new dataset containing 72 Qawwali songs of one-minute duration along with tagged metadata is presented. Majority of samples in the dataset exhibit strong similarity in the fundamental musical properties. This is demonstrated by using the dataset for Qawwali genre detection against popular western music genres. Qawwali detection is a heuristic based unsupervised genre classification algorithm based on source separation of two major components typical of Qawwali performances namely Tabla and Taali. The algorithm shows an \textit{Accuracy} mean across genres of almost 90\% with a \textit{Recall} of 76\%. Dataset release is accompanied with python programs used to construct and extend the dataset as well as reproducing the results presented in this study. \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Qawwalis have a long and historic tradition in Indian subcontinent music, by some accounts they go back to at least 13$^{th}$ century. One of the earliest Indian classical music families "Qawal Baccha Ghrana" \citep{JayashreeBhat} is credited with refining this singing form as a distinctive genre. Qawwalis been used to recite devotional songs, they have been sung by Qawwal groups on shrines of religious figures across South Asia. Even today they are popular in Indian subcontinent with performances given on happy as well as sad occasions. They are part and parcel of pop culture both in India and Pakistan with songs of this genre often included as part of film and commercial music.

Qawwali performances can incorporate both classical and modern musical elements, however the raga oriented melodies employed herein is similar to many other classical genres like Khayal, Ghazal or Thumri \citep{qureshi1986sufi}. Two perceptually differentiating factors of Qawwali performance are both related to rhythm and beat patterns. Similar to other Indian classical music genres, the percussion instrument Tabla \endnote{Tabla \\  \url{https://sriveenavani.com/Tabla}} supplies rhythm, but in Qawwali genre the rhythm patterns (Taals) are quite limited in scope. E.g. most Qawwalis employ Keherwa \endnote{Keherwa \\ \url{https://www.taalgyan.com/taals/keherwa}} and Dadra\endnote{Dadra \\ \url {https://www.taalgyan.com/taals/dadra/}} Taal patterns with eight and six beats respectively. A secondary rhythm pattern within Qawwalis is led by backing vocals clapping their hands at a periodic interval named as Taali (not to be confused with Taals). Both Tabla and Taali combine to give Qawwalis their characteristic beat structure.

Music information retrieval studies targeting dataset(s) from Indian subcontinent have been reported in much fewer numbers as compared to their western counterparts.\citep{carnatic_music} evaluated fundamental pitch of vocals as well individual instruments on six different datatsets focusing solely on classical music. Efforts to categorize Indian music into genres can also be found in internet\endnote{Indian Music Genre Dataset \\ \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/winchester19/indian-music-genre-dataset}}. The open-source MusicBrainz\endnote{MusicBrainz \\ \url{https://musicbrainz.org/tag/qawwali}} includes songs tagged as Qawwali but the distinction between generalized sufi music and Qawwali in this project is unclear. None of these datasets qualify as a source of expert labeblled Qawwali songs. This paper introduces a new dataset containing Qawwali songs suited for cross-cultural music information retrieval research.

Genre recognition is a well established domain within music information retrieval reasearch. \cite{music_genre_survey} gives a good overview of datasets, classification strategies and peformance measures used within this domain. Most studies are limited to western music datasets, genre detection on eastern music datasets are few and far between. For example MIREX 2020 \citep{mirex} included a task to estimate K-Pop genre detection. However, genre detection on Indian subcontinet's music are almost non-existent. One of the earliest studies on music genre recognition is by \cite{gtzan}. They introduced the GTZAN dataset which contains 100 songs of 10 western music genres each and even with its shortcomings is still used in genre classification research. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new "Qawwali" genre that can be used alongside datasets like GTZAN. To this end, "QawwalRang" dataset presented in this paper is supported with an unsupervised genre classification algorithm  reporting results of Qawwali genre detection again the genre included in GTZAN dataset.

Rest of this paper is organized as follows: Next section presents the "QawwalRang" dataset, sources used for compiling the dataset, selection criteria and artists whose performances are included. Section 3 proposed an unsupervised classification algorithm used to label songs as Qawwali or otherwise. It details the features used to individually detecting Tabla and Taali components before making an binary genre classification decision. Section 4 presents the results of applying genre classification on QawwalRang and GTZAN datasets. Observation on which western musical genre may be more similar to Qawwali are also included in this section. Last section of Reproducible describes the software used to build the dataset as well as an implementation of classification algorithm.

\section{QawwalRang Dataset}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Sources}

QawwalRang dataset is a collection of 72 expert labeled songs. Each song is an excerpt from a much longer original recording/performance. This excerpt is re-sampled at 44.1 KHz and converted into a single (mono) channel. The duration of the excerpt is configurable with default value of 1 minute. Original songs come from three sources namely, from internet music sharing platform(s), among others, YouTube\endnote{YouTube: \\
\url{www.youtube.com}}, author(s) personal collection and crawling the web for Qawwali songs. The advantage of sourcing from internet is the availability of huge number of songs, however the sheer number of available recordings, does not guarantee diversity.  For example it is hard to find old or classical pieces on publicly available platform. On the other hand, personal collections may contain limited releases or rare recording(s) but then building a well represented dataset exclusively with personal collection has challenges of it own. For example digital conversion of songs from old analog musical artifacts (compact disks/cassettes) is both a time and resource consuming effort.Table 
\ref{tab:sources} shows the distribution of songs in QawwalRang dataset.
\begin{table}[htpb]

  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{QawwalRang: Source Distribution}
\label{tab:sources}
\end{table}
\subsection{Selection}

Qawwali being an old and popular genre, there is a lot of room for improvisation, which makes even manual genre labeling of songs as Qawwali a non-trivial task. For instance a Qawwali performance may overlap with other regional Folk genres or it may contains elements characteristic of western pop music. To achieve a meaningful labeling strategy, QawwalRang dataset inducted samples with the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Song is performed by well-known/renowned Qawal artists/groups (also called Qawal parties). While constructing this dataset, one of the aim was to stay as close as possible to the original Qawwali form, while achieving sufficient artist diversity. Including songs from artists associated primarily with Qawwali genre reduces the sample space and makes the labeling more reliable. 
\item Songs start with a introductory section including both essential rhythm elements namely Tabla and Taali. These two components make Qawwali really distinctive as compared to other musical genres of Indian subcontinent. In a very small minority of cases where songs start with a vocal/instrument improvisation but does contains segments with Tabla and Taali components at a later time-point, an offset is incorporated to skip to the time-segments containing Tabla and Taali components.
\item Songs performed in classical/semi-classical pattern have been preferred, again this reduces overlap with other genres like pop, folk and film music. Songs that follow a modern mixture of Qawwali, overlapping traditional Tabla/Taali components with mainstream instruments are avoided.
\end{itemize}

All songs included in the dataset are described by a metadata structure consisting of key-value pairs with following keys defined:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ID: unique identifier of the song in the data-set
\item Name: song's descriptive name suitable for searching in global databases
\item Artist: performer's or Qawwal party's name
\item Location: URL of the original song from which excerpt has been taken
\item Start: Time-stamp in seconds within original song from where snippet was taken
\item Duration: Duration of song snippet in seconds, default is 1-minute
\end{enumerate}

This metadata is part of a release package including QawwalRang dataset and associated software which is able to reconstruct and extend the dataset based on the metadata structure. Please refer to the Reproducibility section for details.

\subsection{Diversity}

During compilation of presented dataset, special attention has been given to diversity of performances. It means to include songs from artists with different styles, active-periods and musical preferences. Figure \ref{fig:author_dist} shows artist distribution in QawwalRang dataset. Among the selected artists Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan (1948-1997) \citep{nusrat} and his group contribute a major share. Readers familiar with Qawwali genre will probably know that Nusrat and his group were the foremost exponents of this genre in the last quarter of previous century. They popularized Qawwali genre with countless performances across the world throughout 70s/80s/90s and have remained widely popular and relevant even in recent times. This made procuring songs from this group much easier. Category of 'others' includes about 10 songs from one artist each. Rest of the dataset is quite evenly distributed among other selected artists.

\section{Qawwali Genre Detector}\label{sec:detector}

The main motivation for developing a Qawwali classifier is to evaluate suitability of QawwalRang dataset for music information retrieval (MIR) research. We wanted to study fundamental signal properties of the excerpts in the dataset and see if those properties can offer insights into (dis)similarity of Qawwali when compared to western genres. Two of the most common signal properties used in music genre detection algorithms are Constant-Q Transform (CQT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) \citep{panagakis}. Former is the time-frequency representation of an audio signal with frequency separation modeled on human ear, while the later captures the timbre quality of the signal. As mentioned before all songs in the presented dataset include characteristic Qawwali rhythm components namely Tabla and Taali, these components are extracted from polyphonic audio using non-negative matrix factorization, an algorithm \citep{virtanen} suitable for unsupervised sound source separation.
The proposed Qawwali genre classification thus consists of two stages, a feature extraction and a binary classification stage. The feature extractor separates Tabla and Taali components from the raw audio data then uses CQT to model the former and MFCC to model the later component. The rationale of computing CQT from separated Tabla source is the drum-like instrument being recognizable with spectral energy in lower octaves. MFCC are on the other hand better suited for Taali since the periodic clap is a short-time highly transient event without a fixed frequency distribution. The binary classification stages uses heuristics for pitch energy and local MFCC extrema points to reach a binary classification decision for Qawwali. This proposed system is shown in figure \ref{fig:block_dia}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1.5, width=0.95\columnwidth]{qawali_detector}
  \caption{Qawwali genre detector.}
\label{fig:block_dia}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature extractor}

Features are extracted from raw audio spectrogram after separating the audio in potential Tabla/Taali source spectrograms. Let $\boldsymbol{S}$ be an ${t\times  m}$ audio spectrum matrix decomposed into sorted feature matrix $\boldsymbol{W}$ and coefficients matrix $\boldsymbol{H}$ each of dimensions ${t\times n}$ and ${n\times m}$ respectively with non-negative matrix factorization, where $n$ is the number of independent music sources the song is composed of.

\begin{align}\label{eq:eq1}
\boldsymbol{S} = \boldsymbol{W}.\boldsymbol{H}
\end{align}

We select $l \in (0,n)$ to extract Tabla spectrogram $\boldsymbol{S}_{B}$ 

\begin{align}\label{eq:eq2}
\boldsymbol{S}_{B} = \boldsymbol{W}_{B}.\boldsymbol{H}_{B}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq3}
\boldsymbol{W}_{B} = [\boldsymbol{W}.\boldsymbol{u}_{l} ...]
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq4}
\boldsymbol{H}_{B} = [\boldsymbol{u}_{l}^T.\boldsymbol{H} ...]
\end{align}
with $u_{l}$ being a unit column vector from Identity matrix $\boldsymbol{I}$ with size ${t\times t}$. In other words spectrogram for Tabla source is simply computed
by selecting columns/rows from feature matrix $\boldsymbol{H}$ and coefficient matrix $\boldsymbol{W}$. Similarly Taali spectrogram $\boldsymbol{S}_{T}$ can be written as:
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq5}
\boldsymbol{S}_{T} = \boldsymbol{W}_{T}.\boldsymbol{H}_{T}
\end{align}

Feature-set for genre detection is then CQT power for the Tabla source matrix, obtained by mapping CQT from Tabla spectrogram and taking norm/energy along second dimension. This transforms the Tabla spectrogram matrix into a feature vector represented by:
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq6}
\boldsymbol{f}_{CQT} = \lvert \lvert f\colon \boldsymbol{S}_{B}\to CQT \rvert \rvert
\end{align}

For Tabla source a median MFCC vector is computed by obtaining normalized MFCC vector from Taali spectrogram:
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq7}
\boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC} = med(\frac{f\colon \boldsymbol{S}_{T}\to MFCC}{\lvert \lvert {f\colon \boldsymbol{S}_{T}\to MFCC} \rvert \rvert})
\end{align}

\subsection{Binary Classifier}

Based on extracted Tabla and Taali features, binary classification on whether the given song can be qualified as Qawwali or another genre is based on the following individual decisions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tabla detector (\textbf{TD}): Does $\boldsymbol{f}_{CQT}$ represent a Tabla source? Result is a non-binary decision with three possibilities\textit{yes(Y)/No(N)/Maybe(M)}.
	\item TaaLi detector (\textbf{TL}): Does $\boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC}$ represents a Taali source? Result is a binary \textit{yes(Y\textsubscript{l})/No(N\textsubscript{l)}} decision.
\end{itemize}
This is shown in the decision-tree diagram below, where leaf nodes \textbf{Q} indicate a decision in favor of Qawwali and \textbf{NQ} is the node for all other cases. Essentially it means the binary classifier categorizes a song as Qawwali only in two cases: first one where both Tabla and Taali were detected and an additional case where Taali has been detected form MFCC but Tabla detection from CQT was a marginal call. The reason is grounded in the individual source detection methods which are explained next.

\begin{forest}
[TD,
	[Y,
		[TL:Y\textsubscript{l}
			[\textbf{Q}]]
		[TL:N\textsubscript{l}
			[\textbf{NQ}]]
	]
	[N,
		[TL:Y\textsubscript{l}
			[\textbf{NQ}]]
		[TL:N\textsubscript{l}
			[\textbf{NQ}]]
	]
	[M,
		[TL:Y\textsubscript{l}
			[\textbf{Q}]]
		[TL:N\textsubscript{l}
			[\textbf{NQ}]]
	]
]
\end{forest}

For Tabla detection a Gaussian distribution is fitted on Tabla source's CQT power as given in \ref{eq:eq6}

\begin{align}\label{eq:eq8}
\boldsymbol{f}_{CQT} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^{2})
\end{align}

where $\mu \in [p_{1}, p_{2}]$ is the mean pitch within an octave band and $\sigma^{2} < T_{h}$ is the variance of pitch (measured in musical notes). $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$ and fixed parameters chosen at the star of the classification process where as threshold $T_{h}$ is a tunable parameter. Tabla is positively detected if a Gaussian curve successfully fits with $\mu \in [p_{1}, e_{n}]$ with a reasonably small threshold value. As described above, Tabla detection is a non binary decision, meaning that an in-determinate decision is made with $\mu \in [p_{1}, e_{p}]$, here a larger value of threshold is tolerated. Anything other outcome amounts to negative Tabla decision. Here $e_{p}$ stands for edge-pitch parameter tunable during experiments.  

For Taali detection, given $M$ MFCC elements we attempt to find a MFCC-index $i \in (0, M-1)$ corresponding to a local extrema point i.e. either $\boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC}(i) \leq \boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC}(j)$ or $\boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC}(i) \geq \boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC}(j)$ where $j \in (m_{1}, m_{2})$. Like Tabla detector above here also $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are design parameters, statically assigned at the start of decision process. Taali decision is positive if such a local extrema is found otherwise a negative result is declared.

\section{Results \& Discussion}\label{sec:result}
Experimental results for Qawwali classifier have been obtained with two sets of parameters: fixed and tunable. Among fixed parameters is the numbers of independent sources assumed to constitute a Qawwali, expressed by ${n}$ in (\ref{eq:eq1}). It is assumed that a performance in QawwalRang dataset contains 4 independent sources namely Vocals, Harmonium, Tabla and Taali, out of which the last two are of interest to the proposed Qawwali classifier. Number of CQT bins in (\ref{eq:eq6}) is fixed at 84 ranging between musical notes (midi-numbers) C1(24) and C8(108). Tabla detection is based on CQT measurements between third and fourth octaves which means $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ in (\ref{eq:eq8}) are set to C3(50) and G4(67) respectively. The last fixed parameter is the number of MFCC used in Taali detection meaning $\boldsymbol{f}_{MFCC}$ in (\ref{eq:eq7}) is a one dimensional vector with $M$=13 coefficients. Source separation, CQT and MFCC are computed with corresponding functions from librosa \citep{brian_mcfee_2022_6097378}, while curve fitting on Tabla CQT to find a peak of CQT energy in third and fourth octave has been done with the help of lmfit optimization library ~\citep{newville_matthew_2014}.

The tunable parameters of the experiments (with reference to previous section) are: edge-note within third octave ($e_{n}$), CQT energy threshold in third ($T_{3h}$) and fourth octave ($T_{4h}$) for Tabla detection and index ($j$) of local MFCC extrema for Taali detection. The proposed Qawwali classifier is governed by these four design parameters. In this section we discuss the impact of each of these parameters in detail leading to a set of values used for classifying Qawwali against other genres in GTZAN dataset. An assessment on each of these parameters in studied in light of four figures of merit (FOM) \citep{music_genre_survey}: \textit{Accuracy}, \textit{Recall}, \textit{F-measure} and \textit{Precision}.

The main objective of these experiments is to find suitable values for tunable parameters such that proposed Qawwali classifier is able to separate songs in QawwalRang dataset from the western music samples in GTZAN dataset; properly tuned parameters should also produce results offering insights into similarities between western music genre(s) and Qawwali. Figure \ref{fig:src_edge} shows the FOM plotted against various values of edge-notes within third octave. In order to drive these results, other variable parameters are given some default values, energy threshold in third and fourth octaves is set to 3 and 1 respectively while local extrema point for Taali detection is assumed to be the middle.  We see that all four metrics saturate beyond midi-number 53 (F3) which effectively indicates an interval of [C3,F3] within third octave. Recalling the binary classifier operation from previous section, this means that Qawwali detector should attempt to find a peak in CQT energy within this interval for positively detecting Tabla.

Figure \ref{fig:src_o3} shows FOM plot against a threshold of CQT energy spread within third octave. Here, we observe that a threshold of energy spread higher than 4 does not improve \textit{Recall} (positive Qawwali detection) but reduces \textit{Precision} and \textit{Accuracy}, this is obvious because choosing a larger energy spread as threshold increased False Positives by pushing more songs from other genres to be detected as Qawwalis due to wrongly detecting Tabla presence.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75, width=0.95\columnwidth]{o4}
  \caption{Tabla Detection: CQT variance in fourth octave}
\label{fig:src_o4}
\end{figure}
Last two plots suggest that a good bet for Qawwali detector is to decide in the favor of Tabla if it is able to fit a Gaussian distribution between [C3, F3] with variance under 4. However as explained in the section, Tabla CQT energy concentration can vary anywhere between third and fourth octave; a "Potential" decision is made in case an energy peak is detected within fourth octave. Figure \ref{fig:src_o4} shows the impact of choosing a CQT energy threshold for Tabla detection in fourth octave. We observe that selecting a higher threshold results in very good recall as almost all Qawwalis in the dataset exhibit Tabla CQT energy within third or fourth octave. At the same time, the classifier identifies a lot of False Positive with a large threshold. These experiments suggest a suitable value of 14 achieving a neutral F1-score.

The last tunable parameter is a local extrema within MFCC vector for Taali detection. That is to say that Qawwali detector decides in the favor of Taali if the local maximum/minimum value falls on a specific coefficient index ($j$). Figure \ref{fig:src_mfcc} shows the impact on choosing local extremum point to be for $5^{th}$, $6^{th}$ and $7^{th}$ coefficient. Choosing another point resulted in vastly inferior performance results. Looking at the FOM metrics from Figure \ref{fig:src_mfcc}, $6^{th}$ coefficient was chosen to identify Taali source within the song.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75, width=0.95\columnwidth]{taali_mfcc}
  \caption{Taali Detection: MFCC local extremum impact}
\label{fig:src_mfcc}
\end{figure}

Based on these results, tunable parameters for Qawwali detector were determined to be: $e_{n}=3$, $T_{3h}=4$, $T_{4h}=14$ and $j=4$. Figure \ref{fig:src_genre} shows the performance of proposed Qawwali classifier using these parameters against music genres of GTZAN dataset.First thing to note is that a great majority of songs are correctly \textbf{NOT} classified as Qawwali. The mean \textit{Accuracy} rate across GTZAN genres comes out to be 90.6\% evaluated across 10 genres. Also a reasonable number of songs in QawwalRang dataset are correctly identified as Qawwali with the \textit{Recall} standing at 76\%. Really interesting are the results for 'blues' and 'classical' genre(s) showing a high false positive rate of 24\% and 29\% respectively. This suggests that in terms of fundamental music properties of CQT and MFCC, songs in these genre have a high likelihood to be identified as Qawwali. A closer look at the results from these genres indicate that increase in False Positive cases is due to songs in these categories returning a positive Taali detection with a suspicion of Tabla. This indicates that atleast in timbre qualities songs from these genres would be perceived much closer to Qawwali as compared to other western genres. For 'classical' genre this can be explained by the fact that GTZAN dataset has many songs as acoustic piano instrumentals. This has the potential of overlapping with harmonium, the leading melody instrument in Qawwali performances. For 'blues' genre, characteristic blues rhythm sounding similar to Taali structure in Qawwali is a possible explanation.

  \includegraphics[scale=1.0, width=0.95\columnwidth]{genreA}
  \caption{Qawwali detection per Genre}
\label{fig:src_genre}
\end{figure}

Perhaps a noteworthy point about these results; they are not about a generalized genre detector being able to recognize a new Qawwali genre. Instead they highlight that QawwalRang songs possess fundamental musical properties distinguishing these songs apart from western music genres. In that sense the proposed dataset can be employed by state of the art genre detection studies aiming to incorporate songs from non-western musical sources. What these results also highlight is that with more intelligent feature extraction and/or classification techniques, there is a huge scope of obtaining detailed insights into cross-cultural music information retrieval, as long as appropriately labeled datasets are used. 

\section{Reproducibility}
Accompanying the dataset are command-line interface (CLI) programs that can used to reproduce the results presented in this study. The software includes a python program to construct, extend or filter songs in the dataset. It operates on a JSON \citep{JayashreeBhat}{json} formatted metadata file, editable by users before building a dataset. As explained in Section 2, the metadata interface allows user to specify an offline songs directory/folder. This feature can be used to rapidly build a dataset from songs locally available songs. Song entries in metadata structure specifying online mode are downloaded, processed and then included in the resulting dataset. A python implementation of proposed Qawwali detector is also part of the released software. It operates on the dataset constructed by the counterpart data builder program. The Qawwali detector program produces classification results per song with a summary at the end showing how many songs within the dataset were classified as Qawwali. This program can optionally be run in a feature-extraction mode, during which features are extracted and saved locally. This mode skips classification. This can be useful later with the program running classifier on multiple feature-sets each of which may belong to a different genre. The Qawwali detector program also supports a comparison option in which Qawwali classification results from various genres can be compared against each other.
